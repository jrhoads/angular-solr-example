# Solr Directives for Angular

This set of directives allows you to build a declarative interface with
solr.

## Requirements

- AngularJS

## Usage

Load the script file: solr.js into your application
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="solr.js"></script>
```

Add the solr module as a dependency to your application module:
```js
var app = angular.module("MyApp", ["solr"]);
```

### Main Solr Element

Add the main solr element to your html.  You must set the solr-url
attribute for the search to work.
If you wish to display the resulting documents you must declare
docs="docs" as well.  

```html
<solr solr-url="'YOUR_SOLR_URL'" docs="docs" num-found="numFound" >
</solr>
```

This will accept the following parameters in the url

- q - the query
- rows - the maximum number of results

### Displaying Results

To display the results of your query, iterate through the docs from
within the solr element

```html
<solr solr-url="'YOUR_SOLR_URL'" docs="docs" num-found="numFound" >
  <div ng-repeat="doc in docs">
    {{doc.primary_title}}
  </div>
</solr>
```

You can, of course replace the interior document display with your own
template

### Adding a Srearch Box

To display a search box within the page use the "solr-search" element

```html
<solr solr-url="'YOUR_SOLR_URL'" docs="docs" num-found="numFound">
  <solr-search preload='true' query=''></solr-search>
  <div ng-repeat="doc in docs">
    {{doc.primary_title}}
  </div>
</solr>
```
Optionally you may wish to add a query into the search box.  Use the
'query' attribute for that.
Optinoally you may wish to tell the query to run upon loading thepage.
Use the "preload='true'" for that

```html
<solr solr-url="'YOUR_SOLR_URL'" docs="docs" num-found="numFound">
  <solr-search preload='true' query='YOUR_QUERY'></solr-search>
  <div ng-repeat="doc in docs">
    {{doc.primary_title}}
  </div>
</solr>
```

### Adding Facets

Solr is useful as a search but it starts to shine when you add facets.
Here we will use the "sorl-facet-list" and one or more "solr-facet"
elements to add faceting to our interface.

```html
<solr solr-url="'YOUR_SOLR_URL'" docs="docs" num-found="numFound">
  
  <solr-facet-list>
    <h1>Facet List:</h1>
    <solr-facet display="Resource Type"
field="mods_type_of_resource"></solr-facet>
    <solr-facet display="Object Type"
field="object_type"></solr-facet>
    <solr-facet display="Keyword"
field="mods_subject_ssim"></solr-facet>
  </solr-facet-list>
              
  <solr-search preload='true' query='YOUR_QUERY'></solr-search>
  
  <div ng-repeat="doc in docs">
    {{doc.primary_title}}
  </div>
</solr>
```

The "solr-facet-list" element contains all of the "solr-facet"
elements.

Within the "solr-facet" element the required fields are:

- display : The human readable name for the facet
- field : The name of the field that is in solr

Now when a search is run, You will see the results of each facet
displaued along with the document results.
Clicking on a facet will filter your documents down to only those which
contain the facet.
The URL at the top contains all selected facet information so it can be
bookmarked and take you back to the same results.


## Work in Progress
This is all a first run through the problem and the first siginificant
bit of angular code we have developed.
Could use cleaning and refactoring.

- Declaring "docs=docs" in the top-level solr element seems redundant.
- solr-facet-list needs to be declared before solr-search if
  preload=true.  Otherwise the facets are not registered for initial
display.
- Initial facets registration workaround with hitting "search" button automatically on page load - implemented. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26494948/automatically-click-button-after-page-load-in-angularjs
